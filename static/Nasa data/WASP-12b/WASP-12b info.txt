Size: 1.79 Jupiter radii
Distance: 870 light-years
Orbit: WASP-12 (F-type star)
Features: A "Hot Jupiter" with an incredibly close 1.1-day orbit. Its proximity to the star causes it 
to be egg-shaped, as the starâ€™s gravity distorts the planet. It is also being slowly devoured by its star,
losing mass over time.
