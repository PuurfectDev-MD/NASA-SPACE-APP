Size: 2.6 Earth radii
Distance: 48 light-years
Orbit: Gliese 1214 (red dwarf)
Features: A mini-Neptune, likely with a thick atmosphere containing water vapor. It may be an ocean world, 
though its high temperatures (due to its close orbit) could mean the surface is dominated by thick clouds or steam.
