Size: 1.17 Earth masses
Distance: 4.24 light-years
Orbit: Proxima Centauri (red dwarf)
Features: Closest exoplanet, located in the habitable zone. Likely rocky, potentially hosting liquid water.
 Its close orbit (11.2 days) suggests it may be tidally locked, meaning one side constantly faces its star, 
causing extreme temperature variations.
