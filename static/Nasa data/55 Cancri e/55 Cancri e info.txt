Size: 1.9 Earth radii
Distance: 41 light-years
Orbit: 55 Cancri A (Sun-like star)
Features: Extremely hot super-Earth, with surface temperatures exceeding 2,000Â°C due to its 18-hour orbit. 
Its surface may be molten lava. Early models suggested it could have a carbon-rich surface with diamonds, 
though this is still debated.
